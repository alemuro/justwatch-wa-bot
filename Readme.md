# Justwatch bot for WhatsApp

Hello, this repository contains the code of an API REST build with Flask and Pyhton. Once deployed to Heroku, put the endpoint `https://<heroku-server>/query` to the Twilio hook. It will take the TV series or film from the body of the message and then, after making a request to Justwatch, it will return a short description with the different alternatives we can see this. 

## Do you want to try it?

1. Open this link: https://wa.me/14155238886?text=join%20worried-explore
2. Send the message that will be written
3. Start asking them! For instance, you can try it typing `Friends`

Enjoy!
